                            <p>Qudoku, which is a contraction of Quantum Sudoku, is a number puzzle that has its origins in quantum mechanics. Okay, it's not like the Sudoku you know, but it does involve numbers and it is a puzzle. So what is it?</p>
                            <p>Before we tell you that, let's turn the clock back a bit...</p>
                            <p>In 1935 Einstein and his colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen wrote a paper in which they expressed their dissatisfaction with quantum mechanics. It's not that they thought it was wrong, it's just that they felt it was an incomplete theory because it denied the existence of an objective reality and also talked in terms of probabilities rather than making definite predictions about the properties of physical systems. They believed it would eventually be replaced by a better theory that conformed more to their notions of what nature was really like. Einstein's unhappiness with the quantum theory eventually passed into the folklore in the form of the saying "God doesn't play dice".</p>
                            <p>In the mid-1960s the physicist J.S.Bell and, independently, the mathematicians S.Kochen and E.P.Specker demonstrated, in different ways, that the hopes of Einstein and his colleagues could never be met. They did this by showing that theories of the sort favored by Einstein and his colleagues made the wrong predictions for certain types of experiments with which quantum mechanics always agreed. In the more than fifty years since then, the arguments of Bell, Kochen and Specker have been refined and extended in many ways and also subjected to a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated experimental tests. The general consensus among physicists now is that Einstein was wrong and that the weird and counterintuitive features of quantum mechanics he objected to are not artifacts of the theory but reflect actual features of the world we live in.</p>
                            <p>In 1991 the Israeli physicist Asher Peres found a simpler way of arriving at the conclusions of Bell, Kochen and Specker. Peres' argument is presented in the form of a game in this applet. If you play the game and win, you would have succeeded in reconstructing Peres' version of the proof of Bell, Kochen and Specker that Einstein was wrong when he said "God doesn't play dice".</p>

                            <p>The object of the game is to pick an odd number of circles in such a way that each of the numbers that occurs in them occurs in an even number of them. There are many different ways of winning the game, but they all involve picking nine or more circles. Click on “Display a solution” in the menu to see a random example of a winning pattern.  </p>
                            <p>To play the game, place your cursor on a circle and click, causing it to light up red. Continue clicking on circles until you either win the game or are forced to quit. The moves box shows the number of circles picked, with odd numbers indicated in green and an even numbers in red. The scoreboard at the bottom shows how often each of the numbers occurs in the circles you have picked, with odd occurrences shown in red and even ones in green. You win the game only when the moves box and the scoreboard are lit up green. When you win, the title at the top changes from “Does God play dice?” to “Yes, God does play dice!” </p>
                            <p>You can undo earlier moves by clicking on the lighted circles. Thus, there is no need to start again from the beginning if you think you made one or more false moves. If you make your cursor hover over any lighted circle, all the numbers in it are shown in bold font in the scoreboard below, allowing you to better plan your later moves. </p>
                            <p>There is a simple strategy for winning the game. Can you find it? </p>

            <h2> Origin of the game</h2>
                
            <p>Peres-1 is a numbers game that originated in the work of the Israeli physicist Asher Peres (1934-2005) on the foundations of quantum mechanics. It is called Peres-1 to distinguish it from Peres-2, also featured on this site. You don’t need to know anything about quantum mechanics to play either of these games and can go to them right away if you want. But if you’re curious to learn how they arose, read on … </p>
            <p>In 1935 Einstein and his colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen wrote a paper in which they expressed their dissatisfaction with quantum mechanics. It’s not that they thought it was wrong, it’s just that they felt it was an incomplete theory because it denied the existence of an objective physical reality and also often talked in terms of probabilities instead of making definite predictions about the properties of physical systems. They believed it would eventually be superseded by a better theory that conformed more closely to their notions of what nature was really like. Einstein’s unhappiness with the quantum theory passed into the popular folklore as the saying “God doesn’t play dice”. </p>
            <p>In the mid-1960s the physicist John Bell and, independently, the mathematicians Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker demonstrated, in different ways, that the hopes of Einstein and his colleagues could never be met. They did this by showing that theories of the sort favored by Einstein and his colleagues predicted outcomes for certain experiments that differed from those of quantum mechanics. A series of increasingly precise experiments carried out over the next five decades (and recognized by the award of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics to John Clauser, Alain Aspect and Anton Zeilinger) showed that quantum mechanics was right and that Einstein and his colleagues were wrong. The consensus among physicists now is that Einstein was indeed wrong and that the weird and counterintuitive features of quantum mechanics he objected to are not artifacts of the theory but actual features of our world. </p>
            <p>The theoretical arguments of Bell, Kochen and Specker were refined and generalized in a number of ways in the years ahead. In particular, Peres found a simple way of arriving at their conclusions that sidestepped the technical difficulties of their original arguments. If you play the game Peres-1 and win, you would have succeeded in reconstructing Peres’ proof of the so-called Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem that enshrines one of their principal conclusions. </p>
            <p>If you’re curious to learn why winning Peres-1 proves Einstein wrong, click on Explanation in the Menu for a non-technical explanation of why this is so. However, it helps to have played the game a few times and be familiar with the winning patterns, as that will make the explanation easier to follow. </p>

            <h2>Explanation: Why winning Peres-1 proves Einstein wrong</h2>

            <p>The numbers 1 to 24 in the game each represent a yes-no question that can be asked of a quantum system. Each question amounts to asking the system if it possesses a certain property or not, and the system replies with either a “yes” or a “no” (and never a “I don’t know”)**. The four questions in any circle represent a compatible set of questions, i.e., ones that can all be posed of a quantum system using the same experimental arrangement. By contrast, any four questions that do not occur together in a circle constitute an incompatible set, in the sense that there is no experimental arrangement that allows them all to be posed to the system at the same time. </p>
            <p>There is one fact one needs to know about the way the system responds to a compatible set of questions, and it is this: </p>
            <p><b>When asked a compatible set of questions (i.e., the ones inside one of the 24 circles in the game), the system answers “yes” to exactly one and “no” to the three others. </b></p>
            <p>All the experimental evidence we have indicates that this is indeed so in the ideal version of this game in which all the detectors used to get the answers work perfectly. </p>
            <p>An important (and crucial) feature of Peres-1 is that it is possible to ask any question as a part of four different compatible sets. For example, question 1 can be asked as a part of (1,2,3,4) or (1,2,15,16) or (1,4,23,24) or (1,3,17,18). It is natural to think that the system would give the same answer to 1 no matter which of these sets it is asked as a part of. To spell out the reason in familiar terms, suppose 1 is the question “Do you live in Boston?”, 2 is “Have you visited London?” and 3 is “Have you visited Tokyo?” Then why would a person who is asked the question 1 answer it differently if it is asked along with 2 or, alternatively, with 3? The assumption that the system gives the same answer to a question no matter which set it is asked as a part of is termed the assumption of “noncontextuality”. On the other hand, if the system answers a question differently for the different sets, it is said to be “contextual”. </p>
            <p>Einstein assumed that a quantum system always responds noncontextually to any yes-no question put to it, saying “yes” if it possesses that property and “no” if it doesn’t. All our experience with macroscopic objects (witness the example given in the previous paragraph) attests to this. </p>
            <p>It is against this background that we can understand the trap that Bell, Kochen and Specker and, after them, Peres sprang for Einstein. The challenge for Einstein, in the context of Peres-1, is to answer each of the 24 questions with a yes (Y) or a no (N) in such a way that each circle in the gameboard has exactly one Y and three N’s in it, for only then will the answers  always be in accord with experiment (the ultimate arbiter of truth, even for Einstein!). </p>
            <p>But the winning positions in Peres-1 show that Einstein must fail. The reason is that a winning position has an odd number of circles and therefore an odd number of Y’s in it (since every circle is required to have exactly one Y); but, on the other hand, because each question occurs in an even number of circles, non-contextuality would cause each Y to be repeated an even number of times and make the total number of Y’s in all the circles even. </p>
            <p>Since the total number of Y’s in a winning pattern cannot be both odd (to agree with experiment) and even (to be in accordance with non-contextuality), Einstein is forced to concede defeat. </p>
            <p>The simplicity with which noncontextuality can be refuted using the above setup is what distinguishes Peres’ argument from the more involved arguments given earlier by Bell, Kochen and Specker. </p>
            <p>However Bell, already in the 1960s, realized a weakness in this argument: it is the assumption that the system responds noncontextually to the questions put to it. If, on the contrary, the system responds contextually, it is easy for it to change its answers to a few of the questions in such a way that each circle has exactly one Y in it, in agreement with experiment. A quantum system is an exotic entity and unlike any of the macroscopic objects we encounter in our daily lives; thus there seems to be no compelling reason why it should behave noncontextually, as Einstein assumed it would. </p>
            <p>At the same time that Bell pointed out the above flaw, he also found a way of overcoming it and, in the process, arrived at his famous theorem (the famous “Bell's theorem” that everyone talks about). Bell’s strategy can be applied to Peres-1 to convert it from being merely a denial of noncontextuality into a full-fledged proof of his famous theorem. However this will not be done here since much simpler arguments of the same kind will be given later in connection with the Peres-Mermin Square and the GHZ-Mermin Pentagram, also featured on this site. </p>
            <p>And, with that, we will bring this all too brief account to a close. </p>
            <p>**If this game is realized as an experiment in the laboratory, this standard cannot always be met. The reason is that detectors used in the lab are not perfect, and sometimes refuse to fire. In the language used above, this amounts to the system sometimes saying “I don’t know” in answer to set of compatible questions posed to it). However, the game is based on a thought experiment (i.e., one that is possible in principle, though hard to realize in practice) whose purpose is to draw an important conclusion about nature. Accounting for all the imperfections of a real experiment, and still drawing valid conclusions about the way nature behaves at this smallest of levels, is a difficult task that took three Nobel laureates and their research teams many years of hard work to accomplish. </p>
