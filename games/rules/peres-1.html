            <h2>Rules</h2>
			
			<p>The gameboard consists of 24 circles containing the numbers 1 to 24, with each circle containing four numbers and each number occurring in four circles.</p>
			
			<p>The object of the game is to pick an odd number of circles in such a way that each of the numbers that occurs in them occurs in an even number of them. There are many different ways of winning the game, but they all involve picking nine or more circles. Click on “Display a solution” in the menu to see a random example of a winning pattern.</p>
			
			<p>To play the game, place your cursor on a circle and click, causing it to light up red. Continue clicking on circles until you either win the game or are forced to quit. The moves box shows the number of circles picked, with odd numbers indicated in green and an even numbers in red. The scoreboard at the bottom shows how often each of the numbers occurs in the circles you have picked, with odd occurrences shown in red and even ones in green. You win the game only when the moves box and the scoreboard are lit up green. When you win, the title at the top changes from “Does God play dice?” to “Yes, God does play dice!”</p>
			
			<p>You can undo earlier moves by clicking on the lighted circles. Thus, there is no need to start again from the beginning if you think you made one or more false moves. If you make your cursor hover over any lighted circle, all the numbers in it are shown in bold font in the scoreboard below, allowing you to better plan your later moves.</p>
			
			<p>There is a simple strategy for winning the game. Can you find it?</p>
