                            <p>Peres-2 is very similar to Peres-1, but with the gameboard having 25 circles containing the numbers 1 through 40, with each circle having eight numbers in it and each number occurring in five different circles. The object of the game is the same as in Peres-1, namely, to pick an odd number of circles in such a way that each of the numbers in them occurs in an even number of them. Click on “Display a solution” in the menu to see a random example of a winning pattern (of which there are many).</p>
                            <p>The game is played the same way as Peres-1: keep clicking on circles until you either win or are forced to quit. The moves box and scoreboard help you keep track of your progress and the title at the top again changes to “Yes, God does play dice!” if you win the game. </p>
                            <p>There is a simple strategy that always allows you to win the game. Can you discover it? </p>
