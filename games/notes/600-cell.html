		<p>The table for the 600-cell and the winning patterns in it have been taken from<br>
		Waegell, M., Aravind, P.K., Megill, N.D., Pavicic, M. “Parity Proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker Theorem Based on the 600-cell.” <i>Found Phys</i> <b>41</b>, 883–904 (2011).</p>

		<p>It has been shown by Lisonek, P., Raussendorf, R., Singh.V arXiv:1401.3035 that the 600-cell has exactly 2<sup>33</sup> “parity proofs” in it (this being the term for the type of quantum contextual sets being discussed here). However, many of these parity proofs are not elementary, in the sense that they have smaller such proofs within them. An exact count of the elementary proofs is not known, but the number is known to run into the billions.</p>
