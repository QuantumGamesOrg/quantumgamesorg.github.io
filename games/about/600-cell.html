		<h2>600 Cell</h2>

		<p>The 600-cell is the generalization of the regular icosahedron in a space of four dimensions. It was discovered, along with the other four-dimensional regular polytopes, by Ludwig Schäfli of Switzerland, Victor Hess of Germany and John Stringham of England, all working independently, in the late nineteenth century. The 600-cell has many simple patterns within it that provide proofs of an important result in the foundations of quantum mechanics due to the physicist John Bell and the mathematicians Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker. These patterns can be visualized either as tables of numbers or as diagrams consisting of points and lines. In either case, the patterns have a simple and easily recognizable signature that certifies them as legitimate.</p>

		<p>This exhibit shows the patterns as tables of numbers. Another exhibit will show them as diagrams of points and lines.</p>

		<p>A few facts about the 600-cell must be known to understand the patterns derived from it. The 600-cell has 120 vertices that are distributed on the surface of a 3-sphere (i.e., a sphere in four-dimensional space). The vertices come in antipodal pairs, and every pair defines a quantum state, so the 600-cell gives rise to a system of 60 quantum states. Any four vertex pairs that are in mutually orthogonal directions from the center of the sphere make up a “basis”. The vertex pairs, or quantum states, of the 600-cell make up 75 bases altogether, which are shown in the adjoining table.</p>

		<p>An examination of the table will show that each vertex pair, or state, occurs in exactly five bases. Further, every state occurs exactly once in every horizontal row, or vertical column, of five blocks. The system of states and bases can thus be characterized by the symbol 60<sub>5</sub> - 75<sub>4</sub>, with the subscript on the left indicating the number of bases to which each state belongs and that on the right the number of states in each basis (note that 60 x 5 = 75 x 4, as a consistency check).</p>

		<p>The patterns that provide proofs of the result of Bell, Kochen and Specker are known as quantum contextual sets. These sets are just subsets of the adjoining table that satisfy the following two conditions: (1) they consist of an odd number of bases, and (2) the states that occur in all the bases of the set each occur in an even number of those bases.</p>

		<p>The 600-cell has well over a billion quantum contextual sets in it. The pull-down menu allows you to see these sets, or patterns, very easily. If you pick the 30-15 pattern, for example, you will see 15 bases, highlighted in green, with 30 vertex pairs each occurring twice over them (30 x 2 = 15 x 4).  Similarly, if you call up the 48-25 pattern you will find that it consists of 46 vertex pairs each occurring twice, and two vertex pairs each occurring four times, over 25 bases (46 x 2 + 2 x 4 = 25 x 4).</p>

		<p>Checking that a pattern is valid is easy: condition (1) is easy to verify by counting the bases highlighted in green, and condition (2) can be checked by hovering your cursor over any vertex-pair in the highlighted bases, thereby causing that vertex-pair to be shown in bold wherever it occurs in the table. Alternatively, the moves box shows the number of highlighted bases and the scoreboard to the right of the table the number of times each of the vertex pairs occurs among the highlighted bases.</p>

		<p>Instead of calling up a pattern, you could try creating one yourself. Keep clicking on the bases you want and use the moves box and the scoreboard to keep track of your progress. Both the moves box and the scoreboard will be lit up in green when you succeed and the title at the top will change to “God does play dice!” However, making up a pattern by a process of trial and error is a far from easy task!</p>
