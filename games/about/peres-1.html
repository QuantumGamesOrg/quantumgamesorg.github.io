		<h2> Origin of the game</h2>

		<p>The gameboard consists of 24 circles containing the numbers 1 to 24, with each circle containing four numbers and each number occurring in four circles.</p>

		<p>The six inner circles contain the numbers in their natural order, while the outer circles in line with a pair of inner circles contain complementary mixes of the numbers in them.</p>

		<p>The object of the game is to pick an odd number of circles in such a way that each of the numbers that occurs in them occurs in an even number of them. There are many ways of winning the game, but they all involve picking nine or more circles. Click on “Display a solution” in the sidebar to see a random example of a winning pattern.</p>

		<p>To play the game, place your cursor on a circle and click, causing it to light up red. Then keep clicking on other circles until you either win the game or have to quit. The moves box shows the number of circles you have picked, with an odd number shown in green and an even one in red. The scoreboard shows how often each number occurs in the circles you have picked, with even occurrences shown in green and odd ones in red. You win the game only if both the moves box and scoreboard are lit up only in green. When you win, the title at the top changes from “Does God play dice?” to “Yes, God does play dice!”</p>

		<p>You can undo earlier moves by clicking on lighted circles. Also, if you place your cursor on any circle, the scoreboard highlights those numbers and shows below each, in brackets, how often it occurs over the lighted circles, thereby allowing you to pick your future moves better.</p>
