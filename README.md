This project uses [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), so if you edit the .scss files under [scss/](scss/) you need to run `sass scss:css` to generate the .css files under [css/](css/).<br>
Alternatively, use `sass --watch scss:css` to recompile the css automatically (if you are using VSCode, there is a task set up to do this automatically on load; the first time you will need to do Ctrl+Shift+P and run `Tasks: Manage Automatic Tasks in Folder` to enable it)
