            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>The purpose of this website is to introduce undergraduate students of physics, and other visitors to the site, to some of the deep ideas at the heart of quantum mechanics discovered by John Bell, Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker in the 1960s. In the six decades since then, these ideas have been refined and developed in many ways and now form the basis of the field of quantum information technology that promises to give us quantum computers, the quantum internet and much more. </p>
            <p>This website contains two games, two magic tricks and two pattern generators that try to give the visitor a direct feeling for some of the counterintuitive features of quantum mechanics. All the items are based either directly or indirectly on the work of Asher Peres, David Mermin, Daniel Greenberger, Michael Horne and Anton Zeilinger done in the early 1990s. In a remarkable set of papers that drew on each other in surprising ways, these authors succeeded in reformulating the ideas of Bell, Kochen and Specker in ways that not only deepened our understanding of them but also led to new discoveries and developments in the decades ahead. Although a great deal has happened in the thirty years since then, the freshness and appeal of their original ideas have not dimmed, and it is the purpose of this site to present them to the visitor in as simple and user-friendly a form as possible. </p>
            
            <p><b>A brief description of the various displays follows.</b></p>

            <p>The two games introduce the visitor to the notion of quantum contextuality, or the idea that the answer a quantum system gives to a question depends not just on the question but also on the broader context in which it is asked. The games are simple to play and require no knowledge of quantum mechanics. Winning them amounts to demonstrating quantum contextuality, for reasons that are explained in nontechnical language later. </p>
            <p>The two magic tricks are simulations of real experiments that can be done in the laboratory, although we don’t currently possess the technology to perform either of them in the flawless manner described here. Both tricks give the viewer a direct look at the “spooky action at a distance” (now known as quantum entanglement) that so bothered Einstein. </p>
            <p>The two pattern generators each present the viewer with billions of examples of quantum contextuality of the sort they first encountered in the two games on this site. The patterns can be called up from a menu or else the user could try making up one on their own (although this is very difficult to do!). </p>
            <p>While some explanations are given of what the demonstrations teach us, the reader who wants either a technical account or a deeper discussion of the ideas involved will have to look elsewhere. This site has been conceived to give a lay audience a first look at “quantum weirdness” and not to provide answers to all the questions that might be raised by such an encounter. </p>
            
            <p>The site is still under development. </p>
