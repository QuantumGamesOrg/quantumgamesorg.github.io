    600-cell => H4 polytope => E8 symmetry => representation?
    
    Besides geometrical considerations, what physical systems would be realized
    with a Hilbert space with the structure given by 600-cell?

    A rather elementary quesiton: what do orthogonality and completeness conditions
    represent in a representational framework of Hilbert spaces?
